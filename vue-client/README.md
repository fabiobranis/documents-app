# Vue Client

This is the client application of the Documents app structure.

This application uses VueJS and is a SPA.

I used vue-router in this application to manage the routes and vuetify for front-end.

I choose vuetify because this lib is very complete with a lot of built in components that speeds up the application development.

The application lives in src folder.

To run this application locally, you have to run 'npm run serve'.
